  <h1 class="about">A little about me</h1>

    <p>I am 45 living in the Okangan Nation, I was born in Williams Lake B.C. and only lived there till I was 2 so I really don't remeber it.
      My mom moved to Kelowna with my brother and I, he's older by 2 years. she met my dad when i was 5 they married when i was 7 and they never spent a day apart unless it was a hospital stay.</p>

    <p>I grew up in South Kelowna in the second biggest orchard in Kelowna at the time, My dad was the manager of the orchard so he was     always working 12 hour days and my mom was a nurse in a rest home in westbank and she worked night shift for 20 + years. They loved their jobs.I hope to find something I can enjoy as much as them.</p>
