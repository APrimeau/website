  <h1 class="about">A little about me</h1>

    <p>I am 45 living in the Okangan Nation, I was born in Williams Lake B.C. and only lived there till I was 2 so I really don't remeber it.
      My mom moved to Kelowna with my brother and I, he's older by 2 years. she met my dad when i was 5 they married when i was 7 and they never spent a day apart unless it was a hospital stay.</p>

    <p>I grew up in South Kelowna in the second biggest orchard in Kelowna at the time, My dad was the manager of the orchard so he was     always working 12 hour days and my mom was a nurse in a rest home in westbank and she worked night shift for 20 + years. They loved their jobs.I hope to find something I can enjoy as much as them.</p>

  <p>I went to 2 schools growing up first was South Kelowna Elementry and the second was K.L.O. Secondary School. I graduated from K.L.O. in 1997, was a very proud moment for me and my family.</p>

  <p>We moved from South Kelowna to Westbank 22 years ago, was an ajustment to go from a orchard setting to a trailerpark so no neighbours to neighbours every where.</p>

  <p>I now live in a 1979 motorhome with my 2 cats and enjoy my life so far,  Oneday I hope to do well enough I can have a place I can have a extra room for my daughter to come stay with me again.
    So now that I have taken the first step toward that I believe it will happen in the near future.</P>
